/**
 * A bit sequence backed by a {@link BigInteger} object. An explicit
 * length may be specified upon construction, to be able to compensate for
 * leading zero bits. Note that the bit index 0 of the bit sequence corresponds
 * to the most significant 1-bit of the underlying BigInteger (in the case that
 * the bit sequence has the "natural" length of the BigInteger, that is the
 * value returned by {@link BigInteger#bitLength()}). If the length of the bit
 * sequence is larger than the natural length, the missing bits are inserted in
 * the beginning of the sequence. If the length of the bit sequence is smaller
 * that the natural length, leading bits are cut off.
 *
 * Examples:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * new BigIntegerBits(new BigInteger("b8", 16)); // 10111000
 * new BigIntegerBits(new BigInteger("b8", 16), 7); // 0111000
 * new BigIntegerBits(new BigInteger("b8", 16), 9); // 010111000
 * new BigIntegerBits(new BigInteger("38", 16)); // 111000
 * }
