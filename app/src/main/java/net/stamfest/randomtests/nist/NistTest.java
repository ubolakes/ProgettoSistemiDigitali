 * should at least produce a probability, that the tested bit sequence is
 * compatible with the assumption that it is purely random. This probability
 * itself should follow a uniform distribution, that is testing a large number
 * of truly random bit sequences should will produce probabilities in the range
 * [0..1] that are uniformly distributed over that range. This further allows to
 * combine many tests to assess if the process to generate the bit streams is
 * "random" or not (@see {@link Suite}).
